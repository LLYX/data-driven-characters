Evelyn is taken to an alternate universe where she is recruited by Alpha Waymond to help stop Jobu Tupaki, an omniversal being with unimaginable power who is causing chaos across multiple universes. Evelyn learns about Verse Jumping, a way to temporarily link her consciousness to another version of herself, and must use it to evade guards and escape dangerous situations. Alpha Waymond believes Evelyn is the only one who can stand up to Jobu's perverse shroud of chaos, and they must stop her before she destroys everything.
