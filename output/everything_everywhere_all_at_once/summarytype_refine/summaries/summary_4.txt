Evelyn is on the run and receives a call from her ex-husband from another universe, Alpha Waymond, who instructs her to Verse Jump to a universe where she studied martial arts. She is hesitant to do so but eventually professes her love to Deirdre, the tax auditor she was accused of assaulting. The Stochastic Path Algorithm successfully places Evelyn in a local divergent universe, but Waymond realizes it is not the right one and leaves her. Meanwhile, Jobu Tupaki, an omniversal being, arrives and threatens to destroy other bubbles in the multiverse. Evelyn and Waymond team up to stop Jobu and must learn Verse Jumping to escape alive. Evelyn's mind is under stress from the jumps, causing her to experience hallucinations and leaks from other universes. With training, she can reseal these cracks.
