Evelyn and Waymond team up to stop Jobu, an omniversal being, who threatens to destroy other bubbles in the multiverse. However, every jump causes cracks in Evelyn's mind, leading to hallucinations and leaks from other universes. With training, she can reseal these cracks. Waymond reveals that Evelyn's mind was fractured in the Alpha verse, causing her to command the infinite knowledge and power of the multiverse, but also lose any sense of morality and belief in objective truth. They discover that Jobu is looking for Evelyn, and after a series of jumps and encounters, they end up off the map. Along the way, they must resist the temptations of other universes and stay focused on their mission.
