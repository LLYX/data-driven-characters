Evelyn and Waymond's mission to stop Jobu continues, but Evelyn's mind is becoming more fractured with each jump, leading to hallucinations and leaks from other universes. Waymond reveals that her mind was fractured in the Alpha verse, giving her infinite knowledge and power but causing her to lose any sense of morality and belief in objective truth. They must resist temptations and stay focused on their mission as they jump through strange universes, including one where everyone has hot dogs for fingers. They also meet Alpha Gong Gong, who reveals that Evelyn's powers could stop Jobu, but her parents are hesitant to risk the safety of the Alpha verse. Joy appears in different universes and may be under the control of other versions of themselves. As they encounter danger and chaos, Evelyn's mind succumbs to the darkness, and her family must make difficult decisions to stop her before she becomes another Jobu Tupaki.
