Evelyn and Waymond continue their mission to stop Jobu, but with every jump, cracks in Evelyn's mind lead to hallucinations and leaks from other universes. Waymond reveals that Evelyn's mind was fractured in the Alpha verse, causing her to command the infinite knowledge and power of the multiverse but also lose any sense of morality and belief in objective truth. As they jump through different universes, they must resist temptations and stay focused on their mission. They end up off the map, where Jobu is looking for Evelyn. Along the way, they encounter strange universes, including one where everyone has hot dogs for fingers. They also meet Alpha Gong Gong, who reveals that Evelyn's powers could stop Jobu. However, her mind is already succumbing to chaos, and her parents are hesitant to risk the safety of the Alpha verse. They must also deal with Joy, who appears in different universes and may be under the control of other universes' versions of themselves.
