Evelyn's mind becomes unstable due to the stress of jumping between universes, causing leaks between them. They discover that Evelyn's mind was fractured in the Alpha verse while training to jump between universes and now commands the infinite knowledge and power of the multiverse, making her a target for Jobu. As they evade Jobu, they encounter Juju Toobootie, who turns out to be the "Great Evil" Waymond was talking about and the reason for Deirdre's problems. In the midst of chaos and conflict, Evelyn jumps to an unknown location off the map, leaving Alpha Waymond and the others behind. She ends up in a universe where everyone has hot dogs instead of fingers. Meanwhile, Jobu Tupaki continues to destroy bubbles in the cosmic foam of existence, and Evelyn's mind is at risk of succumbing to chaos. Alpha Gong Gong tries to convince Alpha Waymond that they need to take action to stop Jobu, but Waymond is hesitant to risk the safety of the Alpha verse. Joy, Evelyn's daughter, unexpectedly appears, adding to the confusion.
