The stress of jumping between universes is causing Evelyn's mind to become increasingly unstable and is creating leaks between universes. It is revealed that her mind was fractured while training to jump, leaving her with infinite knowledge and power over the multiverse, making her a target for Jobu Tupaki. While evading Jobu, they encounter Juju Toobootie, the "Great Evil" Waymond had warned them about and the cause of Deirdre's problems. In the midst of chaos and conflict, Evelyn jumps to an unknown location, leaving behind Alpha Waymond and the others. Meanwhile, Jobu continues to destroy bubbles in the cosmic foam of existence, and Evelyn's mind is at risk of succumbing to chaos. Alpha Gong Gong urges Waymond to take action to stop Jobu, but Waymond is hesitant to risk the safety of the Alpha verse. Evelyn's daughter, Joy, unexpectedly appears and complicates matters. Amidst a family discussion, Evelyn jumps again, leaving everyone behind, and ends up in a universe where everyone has hot dogs instead of fingers. The Alpha verse sends every Jumper with a counterpart in the area to stop Evelyn, who is at risk of becoming another Jobu Tupaki. Evelyn's mind is reaching its full potential, but it is also reaching its mental capacity, and she is at risk of fracturing it. Despite the danger, Evelyn is determined to defeat Jobu Tupaki and save her daughter.
