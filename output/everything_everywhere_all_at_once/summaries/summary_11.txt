Evelyn's goal to defeat Jobu Tupaki and save her daughter Joy leads her to jump between universes, but she discovers that every version of Joy is Jobu Tupaki and cannot be separated. Along the way, she encounters Juju Toobootie, the "Great Evil" Waymond had warned them about, causing Deirdre's problems. Alpha Waymond urges Waymond to take action against Jobu, but he is hesitant to risk the safety of the Alpha verse. Evelyn's mind fractures during training, giving her infinite knowledge and power over the multiverse, making her a target for Jobu. Despite the danger, she continues to pursue her goal, but her mind becomes increasingly unstable. Eventually, she destroys herself to escape the chaos, leaving behind her family and the multiverse in turmoil, while Jobu is ultimately defeated in a battle that spans time and space.
