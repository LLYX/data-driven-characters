The stress of jumping between universes is causing Evelyn's mind to become increasingly unstable, and she is at risk of succumbing to chaos. However, she is determined to defeat Jobu Tupaki and save her daughter, Joy. Jobu is destroying bubbles in the cosmic foam of existence, and Evelyn's mind is at risk of fracturing. It is revealed that every version of Joy is Jobu Tupaki, and they cannot be separated. Evelyn encounters Juju Toobootie, the "Great Evil" Waymond had warned them about and the cause of Deirdre's problems. Alpha Waymond urges Waymond to take action to stop Jobu, but Waymond is hesitant to risk the safety of the Alpha verse. Evelyn jumps to an unknown location, leaving behind Alpha Waymond and the others. Evelyn's mind was fractured while training to jump, leaving her with infinite knowledge and power over the multiverse, making her a target for Jobu Tupaki. Despite the danger, she continues to pursue her goal.
