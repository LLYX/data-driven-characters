Evelyn accidentally assaults an IRS agent, leading to chaos and a jump between universes with Alpha Waymond to escape from Jobu Tupaki, an omniversal being of unimaginable power who is destroying bubbles in the cosmic foam of existence. They search for the one who can stand up to her perverse shroud of chaos. Meanwhile, Deirdre is struggling with her taxes and Alpha Waymond seeks her help to stop the great evil that has spread chaos throughout the multiverse. In the process, they use a Stochastic Path Algorithm to jump between universes, and Evelyn must concentrate on a universe in which she studied martial arts to fight against Jobu. With Evelyn's help, they manage to escape, but her mind becomes unstable due to the stress of the jump, causing leaks between universes. They continue their quest to find the one who can stop Jobu.
