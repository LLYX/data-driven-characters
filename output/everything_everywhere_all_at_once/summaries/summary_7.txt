Evelyn's mind is becoming increasingly unstable due to the stress of jumping between universes, causing leaks between them. It is revealed that her mind was fractured while training to jump, leaving her with infinite knowledge and power over the multiverse, making her a target for Jobu. While evading Jobu, they encounter Juju Toobootie, the "Great Evil" Waymond had warned them about, and the cause of Deirdre's problems. In the midst of chaos and conflict, Evelyn jumps to an unknown location, leaving behind Alpha Waymond and the others. Meanwhile, Jobu continues to destroy bubbles in the cosmic foam of existence, and Evelyn's mind is at risk of succumbing to chaos. Alpha Gong Gong urges Waymond to take action to stop Jobu, but Waymond is hesitant to risk the safety of the Alpha verse. Joy, Evelyn's daughter, unexpectedly appears and complicates matters. Amidst a family discussion, Evelyn jumps again, leaving everyone behind, and ends up in a universe where everyone has hot dogs instead of fingers. The Alpha verse sends every Jumper with a counterpart in the area to stop Evelyn, who is at risk of becoming another Jobu Tupaki.
