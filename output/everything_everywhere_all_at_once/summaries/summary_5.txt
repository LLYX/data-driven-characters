Evelyn and Alpha Waymond continue their quest to find someone who can stand up to Jobu Tupaki, the omniversal being of unimaginable power who is destroying bubbles in the cosmic foam of existence. However, Evelyn's mind becomes unstable due to the stress of jumping between universes, causing leaks between them. They discover that Evelyn's mind was fractured in the Alpha verse while training to jump between universes and now commands the infinite knowledge and power of the multiverse, making her a target for Jobu. As they evade Jobu, they encounter Juju Toobootie, who turns out to be the "Great Evil" Waymond was talking about and the reason for Deirdre's problems. In the midst of chaos and conflict, Evelyn jumps to an unknown location off the map, leaving Alpha Waymond and the others behind.
