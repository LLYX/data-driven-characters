Maverick trains a group of graduates to take out an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant in a GPS-jammed valley defended by surface-to-air missiles and fifth-generation fighters. He must narrow down a pool of 12 graduates to six who will fly the mission, including the son of his former flying partner, Goose. Maverick pushes the graduates beyond their limits to find out what they are made of, including an exercise involving dog fighting and shooting him down. Meanwhile, Maverick reconnects with an old flame and encounters some of his fellow naval aviators at a bar. During a briefing, Maverick requests to lower the hard deck to practice a low-level bombing run per the mission parameters, but faces scrutiny from his superior.
