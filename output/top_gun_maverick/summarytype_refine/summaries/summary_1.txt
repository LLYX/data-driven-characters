After being called back to Top Gun, Maverick is tasked with training a group of graduates for a mission to take out an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant in a GPS-jammed valley defended by surface-to-air missiles and fifth-generation fighters. Maverick must narrow down a pool of 12 graduates to six who will fly the mission. However, Maverick is reluctant to take on the job, especially since one of the graduates is Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster," the son of his former flying partner, Goose. Despite his reservations, Maverick agrees to teach the graduates. Meanwhile, Maverick reconnects with Penny, an old flame, and encounters some of his fellow naval aviators at a bar.
