The movie Top Gun: Maverick follows the story of Rooster disobeying orders to fly a recovered F-14 and successfully taking out the enemy planes in a dogfight. Maverick's plane is hit and he is presumed dead, but he is brought back to the boat and crash-lands without front landing gear or a tail hook. He survives and is hailed as an ace, and he reunites with Jimmy, but Penny is away on a sailing trip. The movie ends with the song "Hold My Hand" playing. The lyrics of the song convey a message of support and comfort for those who are hurting or bleeding, promising to be there until the end. The line "I heard from the heavens" suggests that this support is divine in nature.
