Maverick, a former Top Gun pilot, is called back to train a group of graduates for a mission to take out an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant in a GPS-jammed valley defended by surface-to-air missiles and fifth-generation fighters. Maverick must narrow down a pool of 12 graduates to six who will fly the mission, including Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster," the son of his former flying partner, Goose. Maverick reconnects with Penny, an old flame, and encounters some of his fellow naval aviators at a bar. The next day, Maverick begins training the graduates in basic fighter maneuvers, starting with dog fighting. The exercise involves shooting Maverick down, with the first to be shot down doing 200 push-ups. Maverick is determined to push the graduates beyond their limits and find out what they are made of.
