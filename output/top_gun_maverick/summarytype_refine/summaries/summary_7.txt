The team's mission to take out an unsanctioned uranium enrichment site is moved up a week due to the delivery of raw uranium. Maverick trains the team for a low-level ingress that requires two consecutive miracles. The team faces tragedy when a member's mistake leads to a mission failure. Maverick's past as the son of a pilot is brought up, causing conflict among his fellow naval aviators. The team's final mission involves a secret uranium enrichment site under rogue state control. Maverick is appointed team leader despite the risk to his career, and he chooses his two foxtrot teams and wingman. The team faces heavily defended surface-to-air missiles and fifth-generation fighters during their attack. Tomahawk missiles from the USS Leyte Gulf launch a synchronized strike on the enemy's airfield to knock out their runway. The team has two minutes and 30 seconds to reach their target, and any longer exposes them to the enemy's aircraft. The team must come home safely.
