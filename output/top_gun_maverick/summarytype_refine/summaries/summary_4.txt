Maverick trains a group of graduates for a mission to take out an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant in a GPS-jammed valley defended by surface-to-air missiles and fifth-generation fighters. He narrows down the pool to six, including Goose's son, and pushes them to their limits. Maverick reconnects with an old flame and faces scrutiny from his superior when he requests to lower the hard deck for a practice bombing run. During a briefing, Maverick trains the graduates for a low-level ingress, attacking in two-plane teams. Time is of the essence as they navigate a narrow canyon and evade radar-guided surface-to-air missiles and fifth-generation fighters. Maverick pushes them to fly like him or not come back, but tensions rise when a team member's mistake leads to tragedy. Maverick's past as the son of a pilot is brought up, causing conflict among his fellow naval aviators.
