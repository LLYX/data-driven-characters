After 30 years of service, Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is training a group of TOP GUN graduates for a specialized mission. The program is at risk of being scrapped due to falling short of the mach 10 threshold, but Maverick decides to push the limits to keep the program alive. However, Admiral Cain, who wants to prioritize his unmanned program, orders Maverick to bring the plane down. Despite reaching mach 10, the plane crashes and Maverick is escorted off the base. But he is later called back to TOP GUN for a new mission.
