The team engages in a dogfight with enemy planes, with Rooster disobeying orders to fly a recovered F-14 and successfully taking out the enemy planes. However, Maverick's plane is hit and he is presumed dead. Rooster manages to get in touch with the boat and they bring Maverick back, but he crash-lands without front landing gear or a tail hook. He survives and is hailed as an ace, and he reunites with Jimmy, but Penny is away on a sailing trip. The movie ends with the song "Hold My Hand" playing.
