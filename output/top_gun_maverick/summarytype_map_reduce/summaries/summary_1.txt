Captain Pete Mitchell, also known as Maverick, is called back to Top Gun to teach a group of graduates for a mission to take out an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant. Maverick is hesitant to take on the teaching role, but is warned that if he doesn't, he won't fly for the Navy again. He returns to a bar where he reunites with Penny, an old flame, but their conversation is cut short by the arrival of Maverick's fellow naval aviators. Among them is Bob Floyd, Maverick's new weapons systems officer.
