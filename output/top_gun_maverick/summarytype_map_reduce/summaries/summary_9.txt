Maverick and Rooster board an old F-14 Tomcat and take off from an improvised runway. They are pursued by enemy aircraft and engage in a dogfight. Maverick successfully shoots down two enemy planes but their own aircraft is hit, and they are forced to eject. Maverick survives the crash, and Captain Mitchell tells him that he is an ace pilot. Maverick later learns that Penny has gone on a sailing trip with Amelia.
