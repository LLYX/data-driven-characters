After over 30 years of service as a Navy aviator, Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is tasked with training TOP GUN graduates for a specialized mission. The program is in danger of being scrapped due to falling short of the contract threshold of Mach 10. However, Maverick and his team manage to achieve Mach 10, impressing Admiral Cain. Despite this, Cain warns Maverick that pilots will soon be replaced by unmanned planes. Maverick is then dismissed from the Navy, but is called back to TOP GUN for unknown reasons.
