A group of top gun graduates are selected for a special detachment to combat a new enemy fighter. Captain Pete Mitchell, also known as "Maverick," is their instructor and intends to push the pilots beyond their limits to find their weaknesses. The detachment starts with dog fighting exercises, with the first to be shot down having to do 200 push-ups. Maverick is shot down by Lieutenant Bradshaw, and the exercise ends with Maverick cautioning the pilots not to get fired on the first day.
