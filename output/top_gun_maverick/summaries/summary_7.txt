Pete "Maverick" Mitchell trains a group of graduates for a dangerous mission to destroy an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant. The mission is moved up one week due to the plant becoming operational earlier than expected. Maverick is replaced as the instructor and is grounded permanently. Despite this setback, Maverick steals a military aircraft and successfully completes the mission, leading to his appointment as the team leader. The mission involves a low-level ingress in a narrow canyon with radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defending the area. The mission's success requires precise coordination and the pilots to push beyond the accepted stress limit of their aircraft. During the mission, Maverick and his team face enemy planes and missiles but ultimately succeed in destroying the target.
