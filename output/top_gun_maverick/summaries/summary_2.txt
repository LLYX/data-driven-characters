Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is called back to TOP GUN to train 12 graduates for a specialized mission. The mission is to destroy an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant that threatens allies in the region. Maverick narrows down the pool to six graduates, including Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster," the son of his former flying partner "Goose" who died tragically. Along the way, Maverick reconnects with his former flame Penny and encounters rival pilots from his past. The graduates are in for a tough training program, where Maverick intends to push them beyond their limits and test their skills in dog fighting. The stakes are high, and success now depends on the man or woman in the box.
