Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, a former top aviator in the Navy, is called back to TOP GUN to teach 12 graduates for a specialized mission. The mission is to destroy an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant that poses a direct threat to allies in the region. Maverick is hesitant to take the job, but it's his last chance to fly for the Navy. He narrows the pool down to six graduates, including Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster," the son of his former flying partner "Goose" who died tragically. Maverick must help train the graduates for the high-stakes mission, which involves flying low-level laser-guided strikes and evading an extensive surface-to-air missile array. Along the way, Maverick reconnects with Penny, his former flame, and encounters rival pilots from his past.
