Pete "Maverick" Mitchell trains a group of graduates for a dangerous mission to destroy an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant. The mission is moved up one week due to the plant becoming operational earlier than expected. Maverick pushes the graduates to their limits during training and reconnects with his former flame, but struggles with sending one of the graduates, who is the son of his late friend Goose, on the mission. The mission involves a low-level ingress in a narrow canyon with radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defending the area. The mission's success requires precise coordination and the pilots to pull beyond the accepted stress limit of their aircraft. During the mission, Maverick intervenes and causes it to fail, leading to the loss of a team member and causing him to question his abilities. Maverick also faces personal challenges with his relationship with Amelia and the responsibility of training the graduates. The training is taken over by someone else, leaving Maverick unsure of his future.
