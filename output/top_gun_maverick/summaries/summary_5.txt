Pete "Maverick" Mitchell trains a group of graduates for a dangerous mission to destroy an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant. Maverick faces challenges from his superiors who are hesitant to take risks and change the rules, including the hard deck. During training, Maverick reconnects with his former flame and pushes the graduates beyond their limits to test their dogfighting skills. The mission involves a low-level ingress in a narrow canyon with radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defending the area. However, Maverick is hesitant to send one of the graduates, who is the son of his late friend Goose, on the mission. Maverick struggles to balance his loyalty to his friend's memory with his responsibility as a trainer and mentor. Meanwhile, he also faces personal challenges with his relationship with Amelia, the mother of his goddaughter.
