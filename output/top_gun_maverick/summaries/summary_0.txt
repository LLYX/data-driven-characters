After 30 years as a top aviator in the Navy, Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is training TOP GUN graduates for a specialized mission. The program is in jeopardy due to falling short of the contract threshold, and Admiral Cain wants their budget for his unmanned program. Maverick and his team decide to push the limits and achieve mach 10, impressing Admiral Cain but also causing an accident. Maverick is dismissed from the Navy but is later called back to TOP GUN.
