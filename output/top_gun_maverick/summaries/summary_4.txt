Pete "Maverick" Mitchell trains a group of six graduates for a high-stakes mission to destroy an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant. Maverick faces challenges from his superiors, who are hesitant to take risks and change the rules, including the hard deck. During training, Maverick reconnects with his former flame, faces off against rival pilots, and pushes the graduates beyond their limits to test their dogfighting skills. The mission involves a low-level ingress in a narrow canyon with radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defending the area. Time is the greatest adversary, and success depends on flying like Maverick or not coming back.
