The group, including Thor, Korg, and Valkyrie, learn about Eternity, a powerful being that can grant wishes, and realize that the God Butcher is seeking it. Despite Zeus' objections, they set out to stop the God Butcher themselves and engage in a fight in which Korg is believed to have perished, and Zeus is defeated. Later, the group faces the fact that they failed to raise a god army and are weaker than before, but Thor remains optimistic. Meanwhile, Jane and Thor share a moment discussing their past relationships and their fear of loss.
