Thor seeks the help of the gods to stop the God Butcher, who is killing gods and leaving chaos in his wake. However, Zeus and the other gods refuse to intervene, citing that every god watches over their own people. Thor requests to borrow Zeus' lightning bolt, but in the chaos of the request, Korg is injured. The group learns of Eternity, a powerful being that can grant the wish of the first person to reach it, and realizes that the God Butcher seeks it. Despite Zeus' objections, Thor and his allies set out to stop the God Butcher themselves. In the ensuing fight, Korg is believed to have perished, and Zeus is defeated by the God Butcher.
