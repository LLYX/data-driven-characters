Refined Summary: Thor, Jane Foster (now the Mighty Thor), and their team embark on a mission to rescue children trapped in the Shadow Realm by the God Butcher. To do so, they need an army of gods from Omnipotence City, including Zeus and Ra. They reach the city using Thor's Stormbreaker as a power source for their ship. Meanwhile, Thor faces an identity crisis and personal struggles while dealing with the threat of his long-lost sister, Hela, who could put Asgard's fate at risk. The team must rescue the children while battling shadow monsters and the curse of the shadow-zombie kidnapper. Along the way, they visit the Golden Temple and try to recruit the gods, including Zeus, who proves unhelpful. However, they do realize that Zeus's thunderbolt could be useful. Thor and Jane plan to take it by bum-rushing Zeus, but their plan is put on hold.
