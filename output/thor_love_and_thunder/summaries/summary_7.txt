Refined Summary: Thor and his team visit Omnipotence City to ask for the gods' help in raising an army to stop the God Butcher. They try to recruit Zeus and other gods, but Zeus proves unhelpful and even refuses to let them use his lightning bolt. Thor and Jane plan to take it by bum-rushing Zeus, but their plan is put on hold. Meanwhile, they learn of the Altar of Eternity and how the God Butcher could use it to wipe out the gods. When they try to leave, they are stopped by guards and must stay in the city. In the ensuing fight, Korg is injured, but Thor manages to defeat Zeus and take Thunderbolt.
