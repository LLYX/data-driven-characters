Refined Summary: Thor and his team escape Omnipotence City on a goat boat with Korg, who survived despite being decapitated. They failed to raise an army to stop the God Butcher, but managed to steal Zeus's lightning bolt. However, they learn of the Altar of Eternity, which the God Butcher could use to wipe out the gods. Despite being weaker, Thor is confident that they can still defeat the God Butcher with their new weapon. Meanwhile, Thor and Jane share their feelings of loss and fear of love, but Thor realizes that it's better to have loved and lost than to feel empty.
