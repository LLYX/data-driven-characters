Refined Summary: Thor, Jane Foster (who now wields Mjolnir as the Mighty Thor), and their team embark on a mission to rescue children who are trapped in the Shadow Realm by the God Butcher. To avoid endangering the children, they decide to raise an army and recruit gods from Omnipotence City, including Zeus and Ra. To get there, they use Thor's Stormbreaker as a power source for a ship. Meanwhile, Thor confronts his personal struggles and identity crisis while dealing with the threat of his long-lost sister Hela, who could put the fate of Asgard at stake. The team must find and rescue the children while battling the God Butcher's shadow monsters and facing the curse of the shadow-zombie kidnapper.
