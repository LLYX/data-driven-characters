Thor also grapples with his feelings for Jane and his fear of losing love. When they arrive at their destination, they discover a trap set by Gorr. The battle to stop him becomes more personal as Gorr taunts them about their past traumas and failures. However, Thor ultimately overcomes his fear and uses his newly acquired weapon to defeat Gorr and save the universe. Along the way, Thor and Jane have a heart-to-heart conversation about living in the moment and the fragility of life, and together they vow to finish their mission of finding and returning the missing children to their families.\n",

Jane, suffering from cancer, decides to stay behind to focus on finding a cure and Thor battles with his fear of losing her. The trio eventually reaches the Altar of Eternity, only to discover a trap set by Gorr. As they fight him, Gorr taunts them about their past traumas and failures. However, with the help of the children, who become Space Vikings, Thor defeats Gorr and saves the universe. Thor and Jane have a heart-to-heart conversation about love and the fragility of life before parting ways to focus on their respective missions. Korg forges a new future with a friend named Dwayne, while Valkyrie trains the children to be warriors.
