    "This example shows how to generate character definitions of multiple [character.ai](https://beta.character.ai/) characters from a corpus. For the corpus in this example, we use the movie transcript of [Top Gun: Maverick (2022)](https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/top-gun-maverick-transcript/).\n",

    "1. Put the corpus into a single a `.txt` file inside the `data/` directory.\n",

    "3. Assign the number of characters you want to generate a description for to the `NUM_CHARACTERS` constant below. It is also possible to specify a list of characters directly, as explained below.\n",
