Maverick is faced with the challenge of meeting the contract threshold of Mach 10 to keep the program alive while also dealing with the threat of budget cuts and unmanned aircraft. Despite his impressive service record, Maverick has failed to receive a promotion and is ordered to stand down, but is later called back to Top Gun for unknown reasons.\n",

The captain agrees to let Maverick train the team but requires him to submit written plans for approval.\n",
